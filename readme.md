## About This Project

First of all I would like to thank you for your time inÂ assessing this test. 

Just a few comments:You will find several, Models, Migration Tables and implementations that don't belong to this test scope. As I told Gala, I had barely no previous experience with Laravel as a framework and PHP is not my main language. I had originally planned to do this test during my weekend, but firstly I had to take the time to learn about the framework usage. Since this is itself a time consuming task, I decided to learn it by following a tutorial for building an Instagram Clone (User/Profile/Post System), which would allow me also to save more time by using the same project as a foundation for this test. Unfortunately I won't be able to spend more time in it before the deadline, and I wasn't able to finish this test to a degree I would feel really comfortable with. Nevertheless I would like to share with you my results, hoping that you would also appreciate the time and effort expended into it, even if the task it's not up to the standards of the given role. I think it's worth my time to have a first experience with the framework this way.

Comments:
- Frontend implementation looks a little bit 'Naive' given my lack of experience with the framework. Given the short amount of time, I decided to spend most of it with the backend.
- Pagination is still a little bit clumsy (Same reasons).
- The like system only works one way (Users like but I still had to fix the system to persist/store liked images between browser sessions and allow to "dislike" a comment).

I hope you appreciate my efforts!
Best,
Gonzalo
