## About This Project

First of all I would like to thank you for your time by assesing this test.
Just a few comments:

You will find several, Models, Migration Tables and implementations that doesn't belong to this test scope.
As I told Gala, I had barely no previous experience with Laravel as framework and PHP is not my main language. I had originally planned to do this test during my weekend, but firstly I had  to take the time to learn about the framework usage. Since this is itself a time consuming task, I decided to learn it by following a tutorial for building an Instagram Clone (User/Profile/Post System), which would allow me also to save more time by using the same project as a base for this test.
Unfortunately this took me more time than expected and I wasn't able to finish this test to a degree I would feel really confortable with. Even if I won't be able to spend more time in it before the deadline, I decided to share with you my results, hoping that you would also appreciate the time and effort expended into it, even if the task it's not up to the standarts of the given role. I think it worth my time to have a first experience with the framework this way.

Comments:
- Frontend implementation looks a little bit 'Naive' given my lack of experience with the framework. Given the short amount of time, I decided to spend most of it with the backend.
- Pagination is still a little bit clumsy (Same reasons).
- The like system only works one way (Users like but I still had to fix the frontent to memorize liked images between browser sessions and allow to "dislike" a comment).

I hope you appreciate my efforts!
Best,
Gonzalo
